                What is Flask exactly?</strong></h1>
        <p class="mt-3 mb-3">Flask is a Python library meant for web development. It can use HTML templates to return to
            the client, but
            it remains as a server side first framework which also allows you to write API's in it.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">It uses the templates folder to return the HTML files that you've written with your custom
            styling and templating, which can also use Python code to make the HTML temtlate dynamic.</p>
        <p>This makes writing API's and server code easier as it allows the developer to get things out quicker using
            Python due to it's easy syntax.</p>
